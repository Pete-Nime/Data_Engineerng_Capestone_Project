# Data Engineering Capestone Project


### This project is mainly based on Immigration Data in United States

#### Executive Summary

This overall out come and the scope of the project will be based on the dataset of each respective areas. 194 Immigration Data, World Temperature Data,
US City Demographics Data, and Airport Code Table. All this different dataset will be aggregiated according to respective year, month, day, and etc.
The aggregiation will be done on date by cities, and airports, analysis the temperature and the outgoing of the travellers, and the impact on regional 
demographics. 


#### Introduction

The purpose of the data engineering capstone project is to give a chance to combine what I've learned throughout the program. The method, techniques,
skills, and over all knowledge. 

In the Udacity provided project, will be working with four datasets to complete the project. The main dataset will include data on immigration to the United States, and supplementary datasets will include data on airport codes, U.S. city demographics, and temperature data. You're also welcome to enrich the project with additional data if you'd like to set your project apart.


#### The dataset used in the project are as follows:

###### US City Demographics Data: 

Compose of all the census designed cities in US. The data originated from OpenSoft and can be found in here https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/us-cities-demographics/export/.

#### 194 Immigration Data:

Has a entry form of i94 to US, derives from US National Tourism and Trade Office. The data distionary is as follows

- i94portCodes.csv: Containing city codes that are used in the dataset, the link is here https://www.trade.gov/national-travel-and-tourism-office

- countries.csv. has all the country codes that was extracted from data dictionary.


#### Airport Code Table: 

not quite complex data contains airport codes and corresponding cities. 
The data source can be found here https://datahub.io/core/airport-codes#data


#### World Temperature Data: 

Comes from Kaggle website and has the temperature of vaious cities in the world from 1734 - 2013. 
Can view the data on this link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data


#### Project Outline

- The data will be aggregiated based on the day, month, and year.

- Cities and airport data will be aggregate 

- How the temperature affect and traveller in coming and out going of the travellers.

- And how the impact it has on the demographics 


#### The Executing Setps of the Projects

- Gathering the data and scope how it will be executed.

- Dig into the data and analyse the data

- Define which model would be used on data and how it will be executed.

- The modelling of the data through the ETL process

- And the summation of the project write up.
